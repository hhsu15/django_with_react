# django_with_react

## Set up the environment with npm
- to start, let's download node.js so we can run javascript outside of browser
- `npm -v` to make sure we have it installed correctly
also `node -v`
- to start a project, run `npm init`, this will create the `package.json` file
- with `package.json`, a person can simply run `npm install` after clone the repo and get all the packages needed installed.

## Create a react app
- `npm install -g create-react-app`
- and just run `create-react-app project_name`
- `package.json` will be created for you :)
